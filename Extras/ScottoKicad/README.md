# ScottoKicad

A collection of footprints, symbols, and 3D models for building mechanical keyboards with Kicad.

# Installation

1. Add a `SCOTTOKEEBS_KICAD` path to match where the `ScottoKicad` folder is located.
   ![Preferences -> Configure Paths](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/assets/8194147/5163f9db-0dfa-4ae7-ba4a-295114c5c051)

2. Add the symbol library.
   ![Preferences -> Manage Symbol Libraries](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/assets/8194147/d76cbe33-e155-46d1-98df-d8cd789688e6)

# Common Shortcuts

-   **Add (A)** - Add a footprint or symbol.
-   **Set Origin Point (S)** - Set where everything else will move in relation to.
-   **Move with Reference (])** - Move a footprint with a reference point.
-   **Track Tool (X)** - Place traces
-   **Add Via (V)** - Place a via to run a trace between PCB layers.
-   **Flip (F)** - Switch footprint between back and front of the PCB.
