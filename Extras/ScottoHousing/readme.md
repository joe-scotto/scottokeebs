# ScottoHousing

A simple USB-C housing for these [specific](https://amzn.to/4fx6fHa) connectors. Designed to be used specifically with [30g silicone wire](https://amzn.to/3UQS5Xw) and [2.5mm heat shrink tubing](https://amzn.to/3JbfoZz).

# USB-A

There are also housings for [these](https://amzn.to/47tXvzc) connectors if you want to re-house them in something color matched for your cable.

# Data

If you use these to build a USB-C to USB-C cable, it will not transmit power or data due to the USB-C spec, there are ways to make it work however. I personally use them as split-keyboard interconnect cables as that works perfect and transmits 4 lines for I2C or serial. If you want to make a data cable, you can do it with one end being USB-C and the other being USB-A and that will work perfectly fine.
