# ScottoWing (PCB Edition) (SK26)

The ScottoWing (PCB Edition) is a 3x5 (34-keys) or 3x6 (40-keys) split monoblock ergonomic column-staggered keyboard.

You can read more about the components and how to build it [here](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/keyboards/scottowing-pcb-keyboard).

_Since I release all my handwired boards for free I do not release any files for my PCB boards other than firmware. Please be aware that the only way to get a 3D printed case is by purchasing one through me, thank you for understanding._
